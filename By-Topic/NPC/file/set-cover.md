## Set Cover

### Proof
- by reduce set cover to it, [check](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/bioinfo-lectures/npcomplete.pdf)

### Approximation algorithm
- Greedy algorithm
  - Approach: select the set that covers the maximum number of uncovered elements first
  - Competitive ratio: Ln(s') where s' is the maximum cardinality of a set
