## Learning with Delayed Feedback


### Example
- Ad advertisement
  - In web advertisement, where the information whether a user has clicked on a certain ad may come back to the engine in a delayed fashion: after an ad is selected, while waiting for the information if the user clicks or not. The engine has to provide ads to other users.
  - The click information may be aggregated and then prediodically sent to th module that decide about the ads, resulting in further delays. 
- Distributed learning
  - In parallel, distributed learning, the propagating informatin among nodes causes delays.
