### Main Contents
- Birth and death model
    - sample question: calculating the population at time t
- M/M/k queuing mode
    - sample question: calculate the number of people in the queue
- Reverse Markov chains and its application
    - application: decide the server depature rate base on the arrival rate
- Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation
    - backward
    - forward
    - application: use to calculate the probability of certain transition at time t
-  Limiting probability
    - stable state: main idea `in = out`

### Questions
- In page366, calculation of variance of the time spend in state i?
- In page-370, how the Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation backward and forward different?
